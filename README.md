# TokenTool Moulinette 1.0

TokenTool Moulinette is based on the excellent [TokenTool](https://github.com/RPTools/tokentool) 2.1 which is
a Token creation tool to create png images suitable for Virtual Table Tops.

For Moulinette, the code was adapted in order to manage a list of images and generate JSON output
which can then be later used for generating tokens.
