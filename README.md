# Moulinette TokenTook

Moulinette TokenTool is a fork of the excellent [TokenTool](https://github.com/RPTools/tokentool) 2.1 which is
a Token creation tool to create png images suitable for Virtual Table Tops.

The code was adapted for the Moulinette version in order to manage images from Internet and produce data packs that
can then be later used for generating tokens.

See [Moulinette Tokenizer](https://github.com/SvenWerlen/moulinette/tree/master/tokenizer) for more information.
